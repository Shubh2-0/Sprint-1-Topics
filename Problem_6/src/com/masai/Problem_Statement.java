	/* ## **Problem 6 :**

	Create a class named GroceryItems that has three data 
	members named price of type double, name of type String and 
	usedFrequency of type double.

	The natural ordering of the GroceryItems 
	should be in the descending order of their usedFrequency 
	then in the descending order of their price and then in 
	the descending order of their name.

	Define the Comparator to sort the GroceryItems 
	in the ascending order of their price then in 
	the ascending order of their usedFrequency and 
	then in the ascending order of their name.

	Store any 5 objects of GroceryItems in the 
	TreeSet such that the first TreeSet contains 
	the objects in the natural order but the second 
	should store in the order defined by Comparator.

	If two objects of GroceryItems has same price, name 
	and usedFrequency then both objects should be treated equal.
