- Lambda Expression
- Inbuilt Functional Interfaces in Java
- Collections Framework Problems

## Projects

### Problem 1

Description: This project addresses a specific problem related to functional interfaces. It demonstrates how to implement and utilize them effectively. 💡

Solution:
- What is Functional Programming and Functional Interface ❓
- Implementations of Functional Interfaces:
  - Predicate<Product> ✔️
  - Consumer<Product> 🖨️
  - Supplier<Product> 🛍️
  - Function<String, Product> ↔️

### Problem 2

Description: In this project, we dive into lambda expressions and explore their practical applications. It showcases various examples to illustrate their usage. 📝

Solution:
- Bean classes: Student and Employee 📚
- List of Student objects 📋
- Transformation of Students to Employees using Stream API and map function 🔄
- Sorting Employees by salary in descending order using Lambda Expression 📉
- Printing both Employee's List and Original Student's List using Lambda Expression 🖨️

### Problem 3

Description: The Problem 3 project focuses on using stream API and lambda expressions to process a list of Student names. ✨

Solution:
- Create a List of 10 Student names using stream API 📝
- Filter and transform names with even length to uppercase ✅
- Sort the transformed List in descending order using Lambda Expression 📉
- Print both original and transformed List using Lambda Expressions 🖨️

### Problem 4

Description: This project explains the features of the Stream API in Java and discusses some of the intermediate and terminal methods of the Stream object. 🌊

Solution:
- Features of Stream API ✨
- Intermediate methods example ⚙️
- Terminal methods example 🏁

### Problem 5

Description: The Problem 5 project explains the concept of method reference and demonstrates how to refer to static methods, non-static methods, and constructors using method references. 🔗

Solution:
- Explanation of Method Reference ❓
- Static method reference example ⚡
- Non-static method reference example 🏃‍♀️
- Constructor reference example 🏭

### Problem 6

Description: This project focuses on implementing a class named GroceryItems with customized sorting using the Comparator interface. 🛒

Solution:
- GroceryItems class with price, name, and usedFrequency data members 📦
- Definition of Comparator to sort GroceryItems 🔀
- Storing objects of GroceryItems in TreeSet with natural order and custom order defined by Comparator 🌟
