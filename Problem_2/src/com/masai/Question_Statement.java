/*	## Problem 2 :

		Write the following 2 bean classes:

		```java
		class Student{
		roll,
		name,
		marks,
		address
		}
		class Employee{
		empId,
		name,
		salary,
		address
		}
		```

		- Create a List of 5 Student objects.
		- Transform the Student whose marks are greater than 500 to the Employee object as roll 
		should be the empId and employee salary should be marks * 10000. by using Stream API.

		      **Hint:** make use of the map function of Stream API.

		- Get all the employees in another List and sort all the employee's object according to
		their salary in descending order by **using Lambda Expression.**
		- Print both Employee’s List and Original Student’s List using Lambda expression. */
